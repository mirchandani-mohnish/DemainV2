It displays seat occupancy percentage to reduce crowding to a certain extent. Moreover, it has analytics that can help one know more about the canteen. It also has a comprehensive feedback system. 

Main Features:

we built a web portal that addressed the following three issues:
* Overcrowding
* An Analytics tool for the canteen 
* Customer Feedback

With respect to overcrowding, our portal provides the current filled capacity of the canteen at any given point of time as well as the chances of a student getting a seat. This is done using a ML-based human recognition algorithm which is integrated into a camera/CCTV system across the canteen. The algorithm also regularly appends the data to the server thus storing it in the database. Based on our algorithm, we find that the crowd tends to spread out evenly across the timeline. Not to mention, we get a clearer picture of when one requires crowd management.

Secondly, Our portal also displays canteen analytics for both the customers and the caterers. The customers can view different aspects of the canteen such as popular food etc. The analytics also provides a comprehensive view of how the canteen functions and the major customer trends. This facilitates better canteen management. 
Last but not the least, our tool also provides feedback form for customers. This feedback form gives the customers a chance to put in their inputs with respect to the dishes and services of the canteen system.
